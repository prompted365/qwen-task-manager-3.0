# TDD/BDD Strategy for Qwen Task Manager 3.0
*A comprehensive testing framework for AI-enhanced behavioral systems*

## üéØ Testing Philosophy: Beyond Traditional TDD

Testing an AI-powered behavioral activation system requires a fundamental shift in how we think about verification. We're not just testing code‚Äîwe're testing **human psychology**, **AI reasoning quality**, and **emergent behavioral patterns**. Our TDD/BDD approach must be as sophisticated as the system we're building.

### Core Principles

**üß† Behavioral-First Testing**: Every test must consider the human element. We're testing whether our system genuinely helps people build better habits and overcome task paralysis.

**ü§ñ AI-Aware Verification**: Large Language Models are non-deterministic by nature. Our tests must validate **reasoning quality** and **behavioral appropriateness** rather than exact output matching.

**üèóÔ∏è Agent-Centric Design**: Each agent (Perception, Memory, Reasoning, Exchange) has distinct responsibilities that require specialized testing approaches.

**üìà Continuous Behavioral Validation**: Unlike traditional software, our success metrics include psychological outcomes that evolve over time.

## üß™ Test Categories Framework

### 1. **Foundation Tests** (Traditional TDD)
*The bedrock that everything else builds upon*

```python
# Example: Core database operations
def test_task_creation_persists_correctly():
    """GIVEN a task manager core
    WHEN I create a task with specific attributes
    THEN it should persist with correct metadata"""
    
def test_energy_tracking_calculations():
    """GIVEN energy level inputs
    WHEN calculating patterns over time
    THEN mathematical accuracy is maintained"""
```

**Coverage**: Database operations, file I/O, basic calculations, CLI parsing

### 2. **Behavioral Tests** (BDD + Psychology)
*Validating that our system supports healthy behavioral patterns*

```gherkin
Feature: Energy-Based Task Scheduling
  As a user with ADHD
  I want tasks scheduled according to my energy patterns
  So that I can maintain sustainable productivity

  Scenario: Morning Energy Optimization
    Given my historical energy data shows high morning mental energy
    And I have both creative and administrative tasks pending
    When the system prioritizes my day
    Then creative tasks should be scheduled for morning slots
    And administrative tasks should be moved to afternoon
    And the reasoning should be transparent to the user
```

**Coverage**: Prioritization logic, energy mapping, behavioral interventions, reflection quality

### 3. **AI Reasoning Tests** (Quality + Consistency)
*Ensuring our AI partner makes sound decisions*

```python
def test_task_clarification_follows_smart_criteria():
    """GIVEN vague task input: 'fix the website'
    WHEN Qwen clarifies the task
    THEN output should include:
    - Specific action (identify what to fix)
    - Measurable outcome (define 'fixed')
    - Time estimation
    - Context preservation"""

def test_prioritization_considers_energy_context():
    """GIVEN tasks with different energy requirements
    AND current user energy state
    WHEN AI prioritizes tasks
    THEN high-energy tasks should not be suggested during low-energy periods
    AND reasoning should explain energy matching"""
```

**Coverage**: Prompt engineering validation, reasoning consistency, output quality assessment

### 4. **Agent Communication Tests** (Integration + IPC)
*Verifying our modular architecture works as a coherent system*

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_perception_to_reasoning_flow():
    """GIVEN file system changes detected by Perception
    WHEN context update is sent to Reasoning agent
    THEN task priorities should update appropriately
    AND inter-agent message format should be valid"""

def test_unix_socket_communication_resilience():
    """GIVEN agents communicating via Unix sockets
    WHEN one agent temporarily fails
    THEN other agents should handle gracefully
    AND system should recover automatically"""
```

**Coverage**: Inter-agent messaging, Unix socket reliability, error handling, system resilience

### 5. **Performance & Quality Gate Tests**
*Ensuring we meet our ambitious targets*

```python
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_task_capture_latency_under_10_seconds():
    """GIVEN a user input requiring AI processing
    WHEN task is captured and processed
    THEN total latency should be < 10 seconds
    AND user should receive immediate feedback"""

def test_context_auto_tagging_accuracy():
    """GIVEN project files and task descriptions
    WHEN auto-tagging runs
    THEN accuracy should exceed 80%
    AND false positives should be minimized"""
```

**Coverage**: Response times, accuracy metrics, resource usage, scalability limits

## üßò Behavioral Testing Framework

Testing psychological systems requires special care. Our framework validates that we're genuinely helping users, not just executing code correctly.

### Energy Pattern Validation

```python
class EnergyPatternValidator:
    """Validates that energy tracking produces meaningful insights"""
    
    def test_energy_correlation_detection(self):
        """Verify system identifies real patterns in energy data"""
        # Use realistic energy patterns from behavioral research
        morning_person_data = self.load_fixture("morning_person_energy")
        
        insights = self.energy_analyzer.analyze_patterns(morning_person_data)
        
        assert insights.peak_energy_window == "08:00-11:00"
        assert insights.recommendations[0].task_type == "creative"
        assert "morning" in insights.explanation.lower()
    
    def test_energy_mismatch_prevention(self):
        """Ensure system won't schedule high-energy tasks during low-energy periods"""
        low_energy_state = {"physical": 2, "mental": 3, "emotional": 4}
        high_energy_task = {"energy_required": "high", "type": "creative"}
        
        recommendation = self.prioritizer.suggest_timing(
            task=high_energy_task, 
            current_energy=low_energy_state
        )
        
        assert recommendation.suggested_time != "now"
        assert "energy" in recommendation.reasoning
```

### Behavioral Activation Compliance

```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
def test_reflection_promotes_self_compassion():
    """Verify reflections follow behavioral activation principles"""
    completed_tasks = ["small task 1", "small task 2"]  # Minimal completion
    low_energy = {"physical": 3, "mental": 2, "emotional": 3}
    
    reflection = qwen.generate_reflection(completed_tasks, low_energy)
    
    # Behavioral activation principles
    assert not contains_self_criticism(reflection)
    assert acknowledges_effort(reflection, completed_tasks)
    assert suggests_gentle_next_steps(reflection)
    assert validates_energy_state(reflection, low_energy)
```

### User Experience Validation

```python
def test_task_capture_reduces_cognitive_load():
    """Verify the capture process minimizes mental overhead"""
    # Simulate user with high cognitive load
    messy_input = "need to fix website bugs update docs call sarah about project"
    
    clarified_tasks = qwen.clarify_tasks(messy_input)
    
    # Each task should be cognitively manageable
    for task in clarified_tasks:
        assert len(task['title'].split()) <= 8  # Cognitive limit
        assert task['timer'] <= 45  # Pomodoro-friendly
        assert task['energy_required'] in ['low', 'medium', 'high']
```

---

## ü§ñ AI Testing Strategy

Testing AI requires fundamentally different approaches than deterministic code. We focus on **quality patterns** rather than exact matches.

### Prompt Engineering Validation

```python
class PromptQualityValidator:
    """Ensures our prompts consistently produce helpful responses"""
    
    def test_clarification_prompt_completeness(self):
        """Verify clarification prompts produce SMART tasks"""
        test_cases = [
            "fix the website",
            "prepare for meeting",
            "organize files",
            "research competitor pricing"
        ]
        
        for vague_input in test_cases:
            result = qwen.clarify_tasks(vague_input)
            
            # Each result should be SMART
            assert_is_specific(result[0]['title'])
            assert_is_measurable(result[0]['description'])
            assert_has_time_estimate(result[0]['timer'])
            assert_has_energy_assessment(result[0]['energy_required'])
    
    def test_prioritization_reasoning_quality(self):
        """Verify prioritization explanations are helpful"""
        tasks = self.load_fixture("mixed_priority_tasks")
        
        priority_result = qwen.prioritize_tasks(tasks)
        
        # Reasoning should be actionable
        assert priority_result['reasoning'].includes_energy_consideration()
        assert priority_result['reasoning'].explains_ordering()
        assert not priority_result['reasoning'].contains_jargon()
```

### Response Consistency Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.ai_consistency
def test_prioritization_stability_across_sessions():
    """Verify similar inputs produce consistent prioritization patterns"""
    identical_task_set = self.load_fixture("standard_task_set")
    
    results = []
    for session in range(5):  # Multiple sessions
        result = qwen.prioritize_tasks(identical_task_set)
        results.append(result)
    
    # Core prioritization should be stable
    immediate_tasks = [r['immediate'] for r in results]
    assert prioritization_variance(immediate_tasks) < 0.3  # 70% consistency
    
    # Reasoning themes should be consistent
    explanations = [r['reasoning'] for r in results]
    assert common_themes_present(explanations)
```

### AI Response Quality Assessment

```python
def assess_reflection_quality(reflection_text: str) -> QualityScore:
    """Systematic assessment of AI-generated reflections"""
    score = QualityScore()
    
    # Emotional tone assessment
    score.compassion = has_compassionate_language(reflection_text)
    score.encouragement = provides_encouragement(reflection_text)
    score.criticism_avoidance = avoids_harsh_language(reflection_text)
    
    # Content quality
    score.specific_acknowledgment = acknowledges_specific_accomplishments(reflection_text)
    score.pattern_recognition = identifies_useful_patterns(reflection_text)
    score.forward_focus = suggests_constructive_next_steps(reflection_text)
    
    return score

@pytest.mark.ai_quality
def test_reflection_quality_meets_therapeutic_standards():
    """Ensure AI reflections meet behavioral activation standards"""
    sample_completions = self.load_fixture("daily_completions")
    sample_energy = self.load_fixture("energy_data")
    
    reflection = qwen.generate_reflection(sample_completions, sample_energy)
    quality = assess_reflection_quality(reflection)
    
    assert quality.overall_score > 8.0  # High therapeutic quality
    assert quality.compassion == True
    assert quality.criticism_avoidance == True
```

---

## üîÑ Agent Communication Testing

Our modular architecture requires robust inter-agent communication testing.

### Message Format Validation

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_agent_message_schemas():
    """Verify all inter-agent messages follow defined schemas"""
    
    # Perception ‚Üí Reasoning
    context_update = {
        "type": "context_update",
        "source": "perception",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
        "data": {"project": "qtm3", "files_changed": ["README.md"]}
    }
    
    assert validate_message_schema(context_update, "context_update")
    
    # Reasoning ‚Üí Exchange
    priority_update = {
        "type": "priority_update", 
        "source": "reasoning",
        "data": {"task_id": "123", "new_priority": 8, "reasoning": "..."}
    }
    
    assert validate_message_schema(priority_update, "priority_update")
```

### Unix Socket Reliability

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_unix_socket_error_handling():
    """Verify robust handling of communication failures"""
    
    # Start agents
    perception = await start_perception_agent()
    reasoning = await start_reasoning_agent()
    
    # Simulate network partition
    await simulate_socket_failure(perception.socket_path)
    
    # Verify graceful degradation
    assert perception.status == "degraded"
    assert reasoning.receives_cached_context()
    
    # Verify recovery
    await restore_socket_connection(perception.socket_path)
    assert perception.status == "healthy"
    assert reasoning.receives_fresh_context()
```

### Agent Boundary Enforcement

```python
def test_agent_responsibility_boundaries():
    """Ensure agents don't overstep their defined roles"""
    
    # Perception should not make task priority decisions
    perception_response = perception_agent.process_file_change("project.md")
    assert "priority" not in perception_response
    assert "reasoning" not in perception_response
    
    # Reasoning should not directly modify database
    reasoning_response = reasoning_agent.prioritize_tasks(task_list)
    assert reasoning_response.type == "recommendation"
    assert not reasoning_response.modifies_database
```

---

## üéØ Quality Gates Integration

Our testing strategy directly supports the Phase 0-5 deployment timeline with specific quality gates.

### Phase 0 Quality Gates

```python
@pytest.mark.phase0
class TestPhase0QualityGates:
    """Validation for Phase 0 deployment readiness"""
    
    def test_capture_latency_under_10_seconds(self):
        """Core requirement: <10s task capture"""
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Simulate full capture flow
        task_id = qtm.create_task("Complex project planning task")
        clarified = qwen.clarify_tasks("Complex project planning task")
        prioritized = qwen.prioritize_tasks(clarified)
        
        total_time = time.time() - start_time
        assert total_time < 10.0, f"Capture took {total_time}s, exceeds 10s limit"
    
    def test_baseline_metrics_collection(self):
        """Verify telemetry captures required metrics"""
        metrics = telemetry.get_baseline_metrics()
        
        required_metrics = [
            'capture_latency', 'task_completion_rate', 
            'daily_active_usage', 'error_frequency'
        ]
        
        for metric in required_metrics:
            assert metric in metrics
            assert metrics[metric] is not None
```

### Phase 1 Quality Gates

```python
@pytest.mark.phase1
class TestPhase1QualityGates:
    """File watcher and context auto-tagging validation"""
    
    def test_file_watcher_stability(self):
        """File watcher must operate reliably for 24+ hours"""
        watcher = PerceptionAgent([Path("./test_projects")])
        
        # Simulate 24 hours of file changes
        for hour in range(24):
            simulate_file_changes(hour)
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Compressed time
            
        assert watcher.uptime > 23.9  # Allow for brief restarts
        assert watcher.error_count == 0
    
    def test_context_auto_tagging_accuracy(self):
        """Auto-tagging must exceed 80% accuracy"""
        test_files = self.load_fixture("project_files_with_golden_tags")
        
        total_tags = 0
        correct_tags = 0
        
        for file_path, expected_tags in test_files.items():
            detected_tags = perception.extract_context_tags(file_path)
            
            total_tags += len(expected_tags)
            correct_tags += len(set(detected_tags) & set(expected_tags))
        
        accuracy = correct_tags / total_tags
        assert accuracy > 0.8, f"Accuracy {accuracy:.2%} below 80% threshold"
```

### Phase 2+ Quality Gates

```python
@pytest.mark.phase2
def test_calendar_bidirectional_sync():
    """Calendar integration must sync both directions"""
    # Create task with due date
    task = qtm.create_task("Team meeting prep", due="2024-01-15T14:00:00")
    
    # Verify calendar event created
    calendar_events = exchange_agent.get_calendar_events()
    matching_event = find_event_by_title(calendar_events, "Team meeting prep")
    assert matching_event is not None
    
    # Modify in calendar
    exchange_agent.update_calendar_event(matching_event.id, new_time="15:00:00")
    
    # Verify task updated
    updated_task = qtm.get_task(task.id)
    assert updated_task.due.hour == 15
```

## üé® Testing Culture & Best Practices

### The Behavioral Testing Mindset

**Think Like a Therapist**: When testing behavioral features, consider whether your system genuinely supports healthy patterns or just executes code correctly.

**Embrace Non-Determinism**: AI responses won't be identical, but they should be consistently helpful. Test for quality patterns, not exact matches.

**Validate Real Impact**: Use realistic scenarios based on actual user behavior patterns from behavioral research.

### Code Review Guidelines

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Tests behavioral outcomes
def test_prioritization_prevents_overwhelm():
    """Verify system doesn't suggest too many high-priority tasks"""
    overloaded_task_list = create_many_urgent_tasks(count=20)
    result = qwen.prioritize_tasks(overloaded_task_list)
    
    assert len(result['immediate']) <= 3  # Cognitive limit
    assert result['reasoning'].includes_overwhelm_prevention()

# ‚ùå Avoid: Testing implementation details
def test_prioritization_sql_query():
    """Testing database query structure instead of behavioral outcome"""
    # This tests how we do it, not whether it helps users
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Unit tests**: `test_[component]_[behavior]`
- **Behavioral tests**: `test_[user_goal]_[scenario]`
- **AI tests**: `test_[reasoning_type]_[quality_aspect]`
- **Integration tests**: `test_[agent_interaction]_[outcome]`

---

## üöÄ Success Metrics

Our testing strategy succeeds when:

- **Phase Quality Gates**: All deployment phases pass automated quality validation
- **User Outcomes**: Testing validates genuine behavioral improvements, not just feature completion
- **AI Reliability**: LLM interactions consistently provide helpful, appropriate responses
- **System Resilience**: Agent architecture handles failures gracefully and recovers automatically
- **Developer Confidence**: Team can rapidly iterate with confidence in system behavior
