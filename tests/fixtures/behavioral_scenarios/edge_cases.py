"""
Edge Case Behavioral Scenarios for Qwen Task Manager 3.0

This module contains challenging edge cases that test the system's robustness
and ability to handle unusual, complex, or boundary conditions gracefully.
These scenarios help ensure the system maintains therapeutic quality even
in difficult or unusual circumstances.

Focus: Boundary testing, unusual presentations, complex comorbidities,
cultural considerations, and challenging therapeutic situations.
