"""
Therapeutic Compliance Testing for Qwen Task Manager 3.0

This module tests that AI responses consistently follow therapeutic principles,
particularly behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and
trauma-informed approaches. Ensures the system never reinforces harmful patterns.

Focus: Validating that every AI interaction supports mental health and wellbeing,
avoiding toxic productivity culture and maintaining therapeutic boundaries.
