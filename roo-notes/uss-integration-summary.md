# User-Story Synthesiser Integration Summary
*Key architectural decisions and integration points*

## 🎯 Core Architecture Decision

The User-Story Synthesiser (USS) is implemented as an **amebic layer** that wraps around the existing QTM3 agent architecture, providing continuous component-user story alignment validation without disrupting the current system.

## 🏗️ Key Components

### 1. **AmebicMonitor Agent**
- **Role**: Continuous background monitoring of component changes
- **Integration**: Hooks into Perception Agent's file watching capabilities
- **Trigger**: Automatically queues USS analysis when significant changes detected
- **Message Flow**: `Perception → AmebicMonitor → USS Agent → ComponentRegistry`

### 2. **ComponentRegistry Database Layer**
- **Storage**: SQLite integration with existing `core.db`
- **Schema**: Four main tables (components, user_stories, touch_points, drift_metrics)
- **Operations**: CRUD operations for component-story mappings
- **Integration**: Extends existing database schema from `bridge.py`

### 3. **DriftDetector System**
- **Analysis**: Multi-dimensional drift scoring (implementation, interface, purpose)
- **Scoring**: 0.0 (perfect alignment) to 1.0 (complete drift)
- **Thresholds**: Minor (0.3), Significant (0.6), Critical (0.8)
- **Real-time**: Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals

### 4. **FlagSystem with Alert Handlers**
- **ArchitectAlertHandler**: Routes alerts to Architect mode for review
- **QualityGateAlertHandler**: Blocks deployment on critical drift  
- **TelemetryAlertHandler**: Records metrics for monitoring

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Existing Agent Integration
```python
# Extends agents.py orchestrator
class USSIntegration:
    def integrate_with_perception(self):
        # Hook into file scanning to detect new components
        
    def integrate_with_quality_gates(self):
        # Add USS checks to Phase 0-5 quality gates
        
    def integrate_with_reasoning(self):
        # Use ReasoningAgent for story generation
```

### TDD/BDD Integration
```python
# Extends existing test framework
@pytest.mark.uss
@pytest.mark.behavioral
def test_drift_detection_prevents_degradation():
    # Validates USS maintains component quality
    
@pytest.mark.uss 
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_flag_system_alerts_architect():
    # Verifies proper escalation workflows
```

### Bridge.py Integration
```python
# Extends quality gates
def uss_enhanced_phase_gate():
    # Original phase gate checks
    passed, issues = original_phase_gate()
    
    # Add USS-specific validation
    uss_issues = check_uss_quality_gates()
    return passed and len(uss_issues) == 0, issues
```

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

```
Component Change → AmebicMonitor → USS Analysis → Registry Storage
                                      ↓
Quality Gates ← Flag System ← Drift Detection ← Continuous Monitoring
     ↓
Architect Alert ← Alert Handler ← Flag Evaluation
```

## 🎭 User Story JSON Format

All USS components follow this standardized output format:
```json
{
  "component": "Component Name",
  "user_story": "As a [user] I want [goal] so that [benefit]",
  "engagement": "direct|proxy",
  "touch_points": ["concrete I/O surfaces"],
  "primitive_value": "one-line essence",
  "expression": "how value appears physically"
}
```

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

- **Quality**: >0.8 average story quality score
- **Performance**: <30s component analysis time
- **Accuracy**: >90% drift detection correlation
- **Integration**: <100ms inter-agent message latency

## 🔧 Technical Benefits

1. **Non-Invasive**: Works alongside existing architecture
2. **Continuous**: Real-time alignment monitoring
3. **Scalable**: Database-backed with indexed queries
4. **Integrated**: Leverages existing AI reasoning capabilities
5. **Quality-Focused**: Built-in TDD/BDD validation

## 🏁 Key Success Factors

- **Automatic Operation**: No manual intervention required
- **Quality Integration**: Built into existing quality gates
- **Alert Escalation**: Proper notification workflows
- **Performance**: Doesn't impact existing system speed
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation on failures

This USS integration transforms component development from "build and hope" to "build with validated user intent," ensuring every component maintains clear value alignment throughout its lifecycle.
